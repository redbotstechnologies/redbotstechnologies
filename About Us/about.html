    <h1>Remote Work</h1>
    <p>
      Our culture is promoting remote work from anywhere
      Remote work has seemed to become an essential element of our culture. As we see the situation of whole world we
      notice that remote work is rising day by day. Remote working means work from home and you can communicate your
      company or office by email or call. You don’t need to go to office. It has created a lifestyle that allows
      different people to have a different job.
      Challenges and pressures also come with remote working. But it also makes life much easier and comfortable. The
      other elements of life can be managed better by the person. It allows the employees to live healthier life. There
      are less chances of sick absence, money saving and we have access to talented people that are not restricted by
      geography.
      Evidently, recent incidents, such as the Covid-19 outbreak, have only promoted the desire of remote working
      options. It is being discovered by many organisations who have historically operated on-premises that working from
      home is not only a best option but suggest notable advantages. If everyone on the team understands the company’s
      vision can make it much easier to create a high-performing remote culture.
      Famous companies such as Buffer, Mozilla, Citrix and more have no office at all and feature a universally spread
      workspace. In remote working, teamwork does not require all staff to be physically together. Members of a team
      might be thousands of miles apart but with latest technology they are able to function as one well balanced and
      synchronized unit.
      Conclusively, remote working has made the life of human beings easier, peaceful and uncomplicated. Previously, it
      was not seen as a major platform but since we are facing the trauma of Covid-19 so this platform has taken the
      dominant place and has become the essential element of our culture.
